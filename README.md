# Vagrant Berkshelf Plugin

[![Gem Version](http://img.shields.io/gem/v/vagrant-berkshelf.svg)][gem] [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/berkshelf/vagrant-berkshelf.svg)][travis]

Vagrant Berkshelf is a Vagrant plugin that adds Berkshelf integration to the Chef provisioners. Vagrant Berkshelf will automatically download and install cookbooks onto the Vagrant Virtual Machine.

## vagrant-berkshelf vs. Test Kitchen

This plugin was created before the development of Test Kitchen and its usefulness in a post-Test Kitchen world is questionable. We believe Test Kitchen provides a robust and stable platform for testing cookbooks and we *highly* recommend using Test Kitchen instead of Vagrant for your cookbook testing workflows.

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
2. Install the latest version of [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)
3. Install the Vagrant Berkshelf plugin:

  ```sh
  $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
  ```

## Usage

If the Vagrant Berkshelf plugin is installed, it will intelligently detect when a Berksfile is present in the same working directory as the Vagrantfile.

Here is an example Vagrantfile configuration section for Vagrant Berkshelf:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # The path to the Berksfile to use. The default value is "Berksfile" if one
  # exists, or nil if it does not.
  config.berkshelf.berksfile_path = "custom.Berksfile"

  # Enable Berkshelf. If a Berksfile exists or a berksfile_path is given, this
  # value is automatically set to true. If not, the value is false
  config.berkshelf.enabled = true

  # A list of Berkshelf groups to only install and sync to the Vagrant Virtual
  # Machine. The default value is an empty array.
  config.berkshelf.only = ["group_a", "group_b"]

  # A list of Berkshelf groups to not install and sync to the Vagrant Virtual
  # Machine. The default value is an empty array.
  config.berkshelf.except = ["group_c", "group_d"]

  # A list of extra values to pass to the `berks` executable. The default value
  # is an empty array.
  config.berkshelf.args = ["--format json"]
end
```
