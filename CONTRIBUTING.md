# Contributing

## Developing

If you'd like to submit a patch:

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add [tests](#testing) for it. This is important so that it isn't broken in a future version unintentionally.
4. Commit. **Do not touch any unrelated code, such as the gemspec or version.** If you must change unrelated code, do it in a commit by itself, so that it can be ignored.
5. Send a pull request.

## Testing

### Install prerequisites

Install the latest version of [Bundler](http://gembundler.com)

```sh
$ gem install bundler
```

Clone the project

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/berkshelf/vagrant-berkshelf.git
```

and run:

```sh
$ cd vagrant-berkshelf
$ bundle install
```

Bundler will install all gems and their dependencies required for testing and developing.

### Running tests

One-time run with Rake

```sh
$ bundle exec rake spec
```

Or you can setup a quick feedback loop with Guard

```sh
$ bundle exec guard start
guard> rspec
```
